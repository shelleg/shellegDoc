Introduction to Shelleg project
===============================

Shelleg project was designed to consolidate years of experience which is now working in numerous organizations,
the ci/cd stack will consist of the most common tooling and will grow with every variant / integration we may
meet in the future.

This will enable us to "commodify" a full ci/cd stack.
