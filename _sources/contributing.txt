Contributing to Shelleg CI
==========================


SCM Github:
----------

* Organization: `shelleg <https://github.com/shelleg>`_
* Admins `Tikal-devops team <https://github.com/orgs/shelleg/teams/tikal-devops>`_

Repository naming conventions:
-----------------------------

Considering this org might host other repos besides Ansible Roles/Modules I suggest we add suffixes to repo names:

* Ansible Roles suffixed with <role name>-ansible-role
* Ansible Modules -> my suggestion would be to contribute via Ansibles-extras which means we will need to follow their guidelines specified `here: <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/blob/devel/REVIEWERS.md>`_
Any naming convention will probebly come from there ...

Discussions / Help:
-----------

* Let's discuss any others in our `slack channel link <https://tikal.slack.com/messages/shelleg/>`_
